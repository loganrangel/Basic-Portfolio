                Hi! I'm Logan, a Full Stack Web Developer located in Raleigh, North Carolina! I have a serious passion for design, development, and implementation of beautiful products which will create a lasting impact in the lives of others.
                I received my formal education from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill before discovering my true passion for Full Stack development, and so am able to incorporate my classical education into creating intuitive, inclusive, and dynamic user experiences for each of my clients.
            </p>
           
            <p>
                As a developer, I thrive on using my obsessive attention-to-detail, passion for creation, and mission-oriented work ethic to not only change clients lives, but the world around us. I am excited to contribute to a company with similar passions for lasting impact! 
            </p>
